##Description

A music website. That's Pretty much what it is.

## ABOUT
Miplay is created with html css and vanilla javascript using the ES5 and ES6 syntax.

   This sites is built mainly to express my vanilla javascript skills and it's major plan was to make it a client side project. But due to the fact that i had to deply it to the server, i had to build a server, so i used express framework in the node.js library for speedy hosting. Update will still made in the nearest future. Thso web site is created with plain HTML, CSS and Javascript (Node.js is acting as the server). There are no other library or framework that is used in the creation this web application, expect for Node.js which might still play a major role in the future re could be replaced.
