>Needs more update. More stuffs to fix.

This sites is built mainly to express my vanilla javascript skills and it's major plan was to make it a client side project. But due to the fact that i had to deply it to the server, i had to build a server, so i used express framework in the node.js library for speedy hosting. Update will still made in the nearest future.
